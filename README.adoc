*WORK IN PROGRESS*

== Technology stack ==

* https://webpack.js.org/[webpack] with http://babeljs.io/[Babel] using
  https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/[ES2015] preset
* http://eslint.org/[ESLint] with https://standardjs.com/[JavaScript Standard Style] rules
* https://stylelint.io/[stylelint] with
  https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard[common CSS] rules
* *TODO coming soon: Redux & Saga, AVA*

== Development environment ==

. install https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] and run `nvm install v{node-version}.y.z`
  *or* install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] v{node-version} (LTS) manually on your platform
. install https://yarnpkg.com/[Yarn] (latest stable)
. run `yarn install` to download and link project's dependencies into the local `node_modules`
  directory
. start webpack dev-server via `yarn run start:dev` and JSON API server via `yarn run start:api`
. open http://localhost:{dev-server-port}/index.html[React Playground Index] page in your browser

=== Using webpack dev-server ===

With https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/[dev-server], all project assets are processed
in-memory (no `dist` directory).

dev-server watches the filesystem and recompiles project assets on change, e.g. JS chunks whose
content is impacted by the source change. Once recompiled, application's HTML page is automatically
reloaded (this is done by injecting a script that opens a WebSocket connection to the server).

== Basic commands ==

[cols="1a,2a"]
|===

| `yarn run build`
| Build project for production. Outputs are placed in `dist` directory. Performs code linting
and runs unit tests before doing the actual build.

| `yarn run build:dev`
| Build project for development (without optimizations). Same output location as with `build`
script. No code linting or unit tests, just the build itself.

| `yarn run start:dev`
| Starts webpack dev-server, watching the filesystem and recompiling project assets on change.
Serves both project assets and API requests (proxied to JSON API server).

| `yarn run start:api`
| Starts JSON API server that imitates a real backend.

| `yarn run test`
| *TODO implement*

| `yarn run test:watch`
| *TODO implement*

|===

== Other commands ==

[cols="1a,2a"]
|===

| `yarn outdated`
| Check for outdated dependencies.

| `yarn check`
| Validates dependency resolutions in `yarn.lock` according to dependencies declared in
`package.json`.

| `yarn run foo`
| Run a locally installed JS module `foo`.

| `yarn run foo \-- args`
| Run a locally installed JS module `foo` with arguments.
